# 🚗 RL Self Driving Assignment

A simple **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** based project that simulates a self-driving car.  
The car learns to avoid obstacles and navigate its environment using Python.

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how reinforcement learning can be applied in a self-driving scenario.  
The car acts as an agent that:
- Receives **rewards** for correct driving behavior  
- Receives **penalties** for collisions  
- Learns an optimal path through repeated trials
